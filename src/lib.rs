//! # Rust unsized enum implementation
//!
//! In stable Rust as of mid-2020, `?Sized` (aka unsized or trait
//! object or "dynamically sized type" or DST) support is missing in
//! various places:
//!
//! - Rust's built-in enums don't support `?Sized` variants
//!
//! - `Option` doesn't support `?Sized` (because it is an enum)
//!
//! - Rust's `union` type doesn't support `?Sized`
//!
//! - `MaybeUninit` also doesn't support `?Sized` (because it is
//! currently built on top of `union`)
//!
//! So if there is a requirement for unsized types within an enum,
//! some other approach must be taken.  Currently this crate
//! implements a single enum ([`UnsizedEnum`]), with one unsized
//! variant and one sized variant, which is always returned boxed.
//! (This approach can only support a *single* unsized variant,
//! although it could be extended to provide additional *sized*
//! variants.)
//!
//! The enum may be read and modified, including switching variants,
//! even through a trait object reference.
//!
//! # Safety and soundness discussion
//!
//! This crate is intended to be sound, and if unsoundness can be
//! demonstrated, it will be fixed (if possible) or else the API
//! marked as unsafe until a safe way can be found.  However right now
//! the theoretical (rather than practical) soundness of the crate
//! depends on aspects of Rust's safety contract which are as yet
//! undecided.  So if that makes you nervous, then don't use this
//! crate for the time being.
//!
//! The boxed memory is accessed with two structures which represent
//! two views of that memory: `UnsizedEnum` for the header plus the
//! `V0` (unsized) variant, and `UnsizedEnum_V1` for the header plus
//! the `V1` (sized) variant.  `#[repr(C)]` is used to enforce the
//! order of members and to ensure that the header part of the
//! `UnsizedEnum` structure is compatible with `UnsizedEnum_V1`.
//!
//! It's necessary to include the `V0` instance directly in the
//! `UnsizedEnum` structure, because its cleanup must be handled
//! through the vtable.  If no `V0` value is included in
//! `UnsizedEnum`, it seems that the Drop handler doesn't receive a
//! fat pointer, and so has no access to the vtable.  However in the
//! case of storing a `V1` variant, the `V0` value included in the
//! `UnsizedEnum` must not be dropped because it will be invalid data
//! for the `V0` type.  So the `V0` value is made `ManuallyDrop` so
//! that we can skip dropping that invalid `V0` data in the `V1`
//! variant case.  (`MaybeUninit` would be better but it doesn't
//! support `?Sized` yet.)
//!
//! So strictly speaking in the case of storing the `V1` variant,
//! because the `UnsizedEnum` struct contains `val: ManuallyDrop<V0>`,
//! we're working with references to an invalid `UnsizedEnum` (invalid
//! in the `val` part).  However we never "produce" an invalid
//! `UnsizedEnum` value.  `V1` values are produced using
//! `UnsizedEnum_V1`.  The only code that is exposed to the entire
//! invalid `UnsizedEnum` is the compiler-generated drop code.
//! (Whether passing around a reference to invalid data is
//! theoretically sound or not is undecided, but it seems like the
//! [consensus is leaning towards it being
//! sound](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/77).)
//!
//! It's important that the niche-filling optimisation doesn't try to
//! make use of any unused bit-patterns in the `V0` value to store
//! data, because those may overwrite the value for the `V1` variant.
//! However since this implementation is in total control of the
//! structure and the structure is returned boxed, there is no way for
//! a crate user to cause the `ManuallyDrop<V0>` value to be wrapped
//! in an `enum`, so there should be no case where niche-filling would
//! try to make use of the memory within the `ManuallyDrop`.  So the
//! compiler-generated drop code should have no reason to touch the
//! `V0` variant memory in the `V1` case.  So our Drop implementation
//! is free to skip dropping the (invalid) `V0` value and drop the
//! overlaid `V1` value instead.
//!
//! If Rust gains support for `?Sized` in more places, especially
//! `MaybeUninit`, this implementation will be improved to use those
//! features.  That would also resolve the question about the
//! theoretical soundness of holding a reference to invalid data.
//!
//! In addition it's necessary to compare vtable pointers in `set_v0`.
//! This depends on the layout of fat pointers.  This is much
//! lower-risk, since it will fail immediately and very obviously in
//! testing if the layout changes in the compiler.  Also several other
//! crates already depend on this layout.
